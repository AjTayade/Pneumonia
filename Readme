Pneumonia Detection AI Web Application
This AI tool analyzes chest X-rays to identify visual indicators of Pneumonia and COVID-19. It distinguishes these conditions from a Normal lung scan.

##  Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays requires specialized expertise, and delays in analysis can impact patient care. 
This project aimed to create an accessible tool for rapid, preliminary screening of X-rays to assist medical professionals.

### Solution
- A web application was developed that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-rays. 
- After training with techniques like data augmentation and dropout, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.35% on the test set. 
- It demonstrates high correctibility, showing a precision of 95% for Pneumonia cases and a recall of 97% for Normal cases. 
- For efficient deployment on platforms like Render, the model was optimized using TensorFlow Lite and the entire application was containerized with Docker, 
  ensuring stability and performance.
